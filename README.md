## Full Stack Software Developer

I am a full stack developer, 
I have used:
  - MVC architecture: using .NET (c#) or Django (python)
  - RESTful APIs: using Django (python), Flask (python), or NodeJS (javascript)
  - SPA: using react (javascript)

I am currently working on AWS Cloud Developer Associate Certificate, to better understand the process after development and deploying apps manually, devops to create automated pipelines, networking, security, and auto scalling apps based on workload.
